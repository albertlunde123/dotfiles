The approach to global optimzation used by Hammer has one major bottleneck: the evaluation of DFT, which is used to calculate the energy of a given configuration. The evaluation of DFT is expensive, so we are interested in developing a method, which finds the global minimum, with as few data points as possible. A given method will have to balance "exploitation" (of the surrogate model) and "exploration" (of the unknown landscape). Roughly, exploitation leverages the surrogate model, evaluating points where the model currently a minimum is located. Exploration on the other hand, considers points where the model is currently uncertain, with the aim of increasing the models overall predictive ability. 
The surrogate model is a function of the configuration space which outputs two values, an energy and an uncertainty. An updating heuristic is some function of the energy and uncertainty
