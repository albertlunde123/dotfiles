# Molecule Optimization Project

A project focused on optimizing molecular properties using various computational techniques.

## Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the project.
  - `molecule/`: Code related to molecule representation and manipulation.
- `tests/`: Contains unit and integration tests.
- `data/`: (Optional) For storing input/output data.
- `scripts/`: Contains helper scripts, e.g., for testing visualization (`scripts/test_plotting.py`).
- `notebooks/`: (Optional) For exploratory data analysis and visualization.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

(Details on how to run the code will be added here.)

Example:
```bash
# Run the plotting test script
python scripts/test_plotting.py 
```
